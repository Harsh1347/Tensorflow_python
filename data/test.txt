The only reason why I'm giving this movie a 10 star rating is so both Infinity War and Endgame will have an average weighed out rating of 8 stars so I know everyone will be excited to see both movies. If you haven't seen Infinity War yet, you might want to watch that first before Endgame. After you've seen Infinity War, you're gonna love Endgame even better. Yes, some of the Avengers lives are lost, including Tony Stark's, but this 3 hour movie is a great and perfect for the very last avengers movie. I would recommend it. I think it's still playing in certain theaters, so if your theater is playing it, why not give it a try? It may be a really long movie, but they needed tell the entire story after 1/2 of the world population was lost. This basically tells it all. Thanos eventually gets killed in the end, and everyone returns for one last fight. This last avengers film is perfect for any MCU fan, and also great for certain fans who didn't understand the ending of Infinity War. Get it on DVD if you can! It's a really really great Marvel film!!
